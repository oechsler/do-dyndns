# do-dyndns

A flexible and powerful DynDNS solution powered by DigitalOcean's serverless functions ðŸš€

## Prerequisites

To embark on this exciting DynDNS adventure, you'll need a couple of things ready:

- A domain in DigitalOcean's free DNS offering. Get ready to bring your domain to life!
- A serverless function namespace in DigitalOcean. It's time to unleash the magic of serverless computing!
- The DigitalOcean CLI installed on your machine.

## Deployment

Now, let's get this show on the road! Here's how you can deploy the do-dyndns project:

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oechsler/do-dyndns.git
cd do-dyndns
```

Ensure that you have selected the correct serverless function namespace on which you want to deploy the DynDNS functions. Use the following command to connect:

```shell
doctl serverless connect
``` 

It's time to unleash your DynDNS solution to the world!  
Run the deployment command to deploy your code to DigitalOcean's serverless platform:

```shell
doctl serverless deploy .
``` 

Sit back, relax, and watch as your DynDNS solution springs to life. Get ready to experience the magic of dynamic DNS with DigitalOcean's serverless functions!

## Triggering the Functions

All that's missing now is to trigger the functions, for example, from your router's DynDNS service. You can use the `/update4` and `/update6` routes to update either IPv4 or IPv6.
Both routes can be triggered either using query parameters or with the payload in the body of the request.
